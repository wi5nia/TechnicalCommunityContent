# DEMO 1.1: Exploring IoT Solutions

This demo should take about 10 minutes.

## Objectives

The goal is to demonstrate an IoT solution in action (that uses Azure IoT Hub, Stream Analytics & PowerBI) and that even smartphones can be IoT devices. You’ll have the audience point their smartphone browsers to a Web page, have them send telemetry to the cloud and WOW them with live data being displayed in charts.

During this demo, there’s no need to show under the hood, understand the code or explain how the solution is built.

There are a fair number of pages/steps to get this session set up (but a lot of it is pictures), and in doing so you’ll learn plenty that can build your experience and give you credibility in all the related sessions.

## Requirements

An active Azure subscription. If you don’t have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/>

A free Power BI account is required to display the live data. Head to [www.powerbi.com](http://www.powerbi.com) and create a free account.

1.  Click on the Sign up free link at the top right of the screen.

2.  Click the Sign up button in the Power BI tile.

    <img src="./media/image1.png" width="624" height="409" />

3.  Next, enter your work email address. Note that at this moment, public email addresses like Gmail, Hotmail or Yahoo are not accepted.

    <img src="./media/image2.png" width="624" height="290" />

Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition is required only if you plan to manually deploy the Web application.

## Setup

Make sure to create your Azure and Power BI accounts before the event.

Setting up the demo takes a few minutes so make sure to create it before the presentation. Note that the you’ll reuse the same services in demo 1.3 so don’t destroy them right after the end of this demo unless you don’t plan to show demo 1.3.

### Deploy the Web App to the Cloud 

1.  Go to the Solutions folder under this session folder

2.  Copy the folder named WebDevice

3.  Paste it under your Documents folder

4.  Navigate into the pasted folder

5.  Double-click on the WebDevice.sln file, this will launch Visual Studio

6.  In the Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution and select Restore NuGet Packages. This will download the required packages from NuGet.

14. The Stream Analytics job is now set.

### Test what you’ve done so far

It’s now time to do a little test to make sure that everything you’ve configured so far does work. Remember what you have configured: a Web site that will send messages to an IoT Hub instance and a Stream Analytics job that will query the IoT Hub in real time and ultimately provide the results to Power BI.

1.  Do you remember the URL for the Web app you deployed? No? No worries! Click on the portal hamburger menu and click on App Services.

    <img src="./media/image39.png" width="224" height="328" />

2.  Click the name of your Web app and you’ll find the URL in the tile on the right. Click the URL.

    <img src="./media/image40.png" width="624" height="169" />

3.  A browser will launch displaying the site’s home page. Note the URL because you’ll direct the attendees to this page.

    <img src="./media/image41.png" width="624" height="299" />

4.  Click on the Go to Demo 1 button.

    <img src="./media/image42.png" width="624" height="230" />

5.  A unique device ID is created each time this page is loaded. Displayed is it’s unique name and the key unique to that device. The ID and the key are used by IoT Hub.

6.  You’ll see a slider where you can set values from 0 to 100.

7.  The On/Off button is used to start/stop the sending or not of the fake telemetry to the backend. A message is sent every 2 seconds.

8.  Click on the On/Off button and move the slider. You’ll start seeing values displayed in a table, with the newest one at the top.

    <img src="./media/image43.png" width="624" height="354" />

9.  Let’s now confirm that IoT Hub did receive the messages we sent. Head back to your IoT Hub tile in the Azure Portal. In the Usage section, you will see that you have one device registered and the number of messages received. Click on the Devices button. This will open the Device Explorer tile and you’ll see the device that was registered by launching the Demo 1 page.

    <img src="./media/image44.png" width="624" height="348" />

10. Awesome! Now let’s configure a report in Power BI.

### Configure Power BI

The last step to prepare this demo is to configure a report in Power BI.

1.  Head to [www.powerbi.com](http://www.powerbi.com)

2.  You should see a new dataset with the name you typed earlier in the Stream Analytics output configuration. Click on the dataset name.

    <img src="./media/image45.png" width="354" height="512" />

3.  To the right of the screen, you’ll see the table name and the fields names along with a series of visualizations or chart types. Select the Card visualization and check the deviceid checkbox.

    <img src="./media/image46.png" width="363" height="436" />

4.  We want to display the number of devices so let’s change the count to a distinct count by selecting Count (Distinct) in the Fields section for our deviceid field.

    <img src="./media/image47.png" width="339" height="391" />

5.  The count is displayed in the card.

    <img src="./media/image48.png" width="574" height="509" />

6.  Let’s now create a line chart to display the average telemetry for all devices over time.

7.  Click on the Line visualization, select the avgtelemetry and outtime fields. Make sure that outtime is in the Axis section (you can drag&drop it if needed) and that avgtelemetry is in the Values section. *Select Average from the dropdown menu to average the avgtelemetry field.*

    <img src="./media/image49.png" width="349" height="644" />

8.  You should have something like this:

    <img src="./media/image50.png" width="311" height="332" />

9.  Let’s display these two reports in a new dashboard.

10. Click the pin button on each graph.

    <img src="./media/image51.png" width="314" height="240" />

11. Power BI will prompt you for a report name.

    <img src="./media/image52.png" width="624" height="303" />

12. Next, Power BI will ask you if you want to pin the report in a new or existing dashboard. Select New and enter a name.

    <img src="./media/image53.png" width="624" height="304" />

13. Notice that the new dashboard appears in the Dashboard section. Select it.

    <img src="./media/image54.png" width="217" height="429" />

14. Congratulations! You just built your first Power BI dashboard and are ready to perform the demos per the instructions found for each demo.

    <img src="./media/image55.png" width="624" height="345" />

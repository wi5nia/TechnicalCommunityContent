# Session 2 - Starting DevOps #
---

The slide deck contains the main presentation and refers to various demos.

You'll find the demo scripts in their respective folders so you can rehearse the demos.  Be sure to checkout the setup requirements in each of the demos at least one day before your presentation.  You may have 30-60 minutes of setup to do.

Be sure to pay attention to the Teardown instructions to make sure you do not receive excessive Azure service charges.

Note that you will have to do the setup from both SETUP_* folders above this folder, for the demos in this session.  Where there are 7 demos, much of work for the presenter is explaining how things work, rather than doing coding or many changes in front of the audience.
